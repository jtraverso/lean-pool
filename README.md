# Juan Pablo Traverso — contributions to Lean Pool

This public fork records my Lean formalization contributions to
[Lean Pool](https://github.com/Vilin97/lean-pool). It is not a separate curated
library: the upstream repository is the authority for accepted contributions,
review decisions, and integration checks. Code under discussion lives on the
corresponding contribution branches; an open PR is not yet part of upstream main.

These contributions grew out of my work on clique partitions and Erdős problem
#81. The papers and their release evidence are maintained separately in
[erdos-81-chordal-clique-partitions](https://github.com/jtraverso/erdos-81-chordal-clique-partitions).
The contributed Lean code is licensed under Apache-2.0; paper licenses are separate.
Proof provenance and the precise scope of each result are recorded in the PRs
and project cards. Formalizing a classical theorem is not a claim of new mathematics.

Lean Pool sits between [`mathlib`](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4) and [`merely-true`](https://github.com/merely-true/merely-true), preserving Lean 4 formalizations that don't fit mathlib's scope. Instead of mathlib's high-bar human review, it relies on deterministic linters and LLM judgment, so it can grow faster while staying `sorry`-free and pinned to the latest Mathlib. See [`MOTIVATION.md`](MOTIVATION.md) for the why, browse the API docs at <https://vilin97.github.io/lean-pool/>, and explore each project's dependency graph and declarations in the [exposition site](https://vilin97.github.io/lean-pool/exposition/).

Semantic search is also available via the [API](https://search.octo.axiomatic-ai.com/api/search).

So far, projects have been added by hand: each is a suitable, permissively licensed (Apache-2.0 or MIT) Lean repository, bumped to the latest Lean and Mathlib, made to pass [CI](.github/workflows/lean_action_ci.yml) — it builds warning-free and clears Mathlib's linters, the style checker, and the repository quality gates (no `sorry`/`admit`, no axioms beyond `Classical.choice`/`propext`/`Quot.sound`, no `unsafe`/`partial`, file headers, size limits) — and an [LLM review](.github/REVIEW_RULES.md) of fit and significance, then merged.

LLM reviews use GPT-6-Astra at `xhigh` reasoning effort through the Azure VM's Codex account pool, without paid OpenAI API requests or an API fallback. Reviews also show an estimated dollar cost at official Standard API token rates, labeled separately from Codex quota billing. See [review operations](python/azure-review.md) for deployment and diagnostics.

Project PRs also receive an advisory Greptile review, configured in [`.greptile/`](.greptile/), for cross-file integration, reusable abstractions, completeness, maintainability, and measured cost. It supplements rather than replaces the independent LLM verdict.

### Getting started

Requires Lean (via [`elan`](https://leanprover-community.github.io/install/), with the toolchain pinned in [`lean-toolchain`](lean-toolchain)) and Python 3.13+ with [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

```bash
make setup    # pull Mathlib oleans, build the whole pool (~1.5h), install Python tooling
```

To work on a single project you don't need the whole pool built — see the
[fast per-project build](CONTRIBUTING.md#dev-setup) in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

### Challenge mode

[`Challenge/`](Challenge/) is the other half of the pool: open *statements* rather than finished proofs. A challenge is a theorem written in Mathlib vocabulary and left as `sorry`, registered in [`Challenge/challenges.yml`](Challenge/challenges.yml) alongside the English statement it is supposed to say. It is the only place `sorry` is allowed, and only for the declarations the registry lists — everything else in the file must be closed, and every other gate still applies.

Anyone can propose one. The [LLM reviewer](.github/CHALLENGE_REVIEW_RULES.md) judges a challenge on different grounds than a project: whether the problem is significant, whether the Lean faithfully says what the prose says, whether a cited known result is stated the way its source states it, whether the statement is vacuous or gameable, and how many lines of Lean a solution would take.

Anyone can answer one, too. A solution lands in [`Solution/`](Solution/), restating the statement and proving it, and [`leanprover/comparator`](https://github.com/leanprover/comparator) settles whether it counts: [CI](.github/workflows/challenge-verify.yml) exports the challenge and solution environments separately, checks that the statements agree, and replays the proof through the Lean kernel with no axiom beyond `propext`/`Quot.sound`/`Classical.choice`. Because a kernel decides correctness, the [solution review](.github/SOLUTION_REVIEW_RULES.md) is short — and is skipped entirely when the PR adds nothing but the answer.

```bash
make challenges              # what's on the board
make verify-challenge C=<slug>  # replay a solution locally
```

### Difference from similar projects

[Tau Ceti](https://github.com/TauCetiProject/TauCeti) is another approach to solve the same problem. The differences are:
- Lean Pool accepts human-written projects, not just AI projects.
- Lean Pool is not a unified library like mathlib. Most projects are independent of each other.
- Lean Pool only accepts completed formalization projects.

[Palomar Registry](https://palomar-registry.org/) is also similar to Lean Pool. The differences are:
- Lean Pool maintains accepted projects.
- Lean Pool provides tools like search and documentation.
- Palomar is a registry, not a unified repository.

Projects accepted to the Palomar Registry may be submitted to Lean Pool, and priority will be given to them.
